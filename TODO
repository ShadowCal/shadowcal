Found an event on a shadow-test calendar, and it created an event on my main one
All day events from google to google end up two days (day of and day before)
Make sure oauth refresh works (don't think it does)

All Day Events from Outlook to Google shift by one day
Multiday events?

Events from Personal > Test cal don't propogate

Don't dupe syncPairs

update rollbar-gem

Outlook thinks event is blocking but it's not

Delete events

Account-level option to include transparent events

Be able to move / delete shadows

Calendars may only be sync'd once
